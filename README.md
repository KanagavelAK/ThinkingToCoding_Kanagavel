## The Decision Maker – Smart Number Checker
## Logic Summary

This program takes a number from the user and checks two conditions using nested and multi-branch logic:

Whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

Whether the number is even or odd.

It uses nested if–elif–else statements to make decisions step by step.

## Code Summary

Input: Takes an integer value from the user.

Process:
   1. First, checks if the number > 0, < 0, or = 0.
   2. Inside each branch, another condition checks if the number is even or odd using number % 2 == 0.

Output: Displays a clean sentence like:
   1. “Positive and Even”
   2. “Negative and Odd”
   3. “Zero and Even”

## What I Learned

How to use nested if-else statements effectively.

The difference between multi-branch and simple conditional logic.

How to combine multiple logical checks to produce a single clean output.

Importance of code clarity, comments, and structure when using decision-making constructs.
